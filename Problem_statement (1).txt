Project Title: Building a Chatbot for Financial and Operational Risk Guidelines.

â€¢

Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to build a chatbot using Langchain and RAG. The chatbot will be
designed to answer questions related to financial and operational risk guidelines provided by the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The chatbot aims to assist users in understanding and navigating the complex regulations and
guidelines set forth by the RBI.

Please use the financial risk and operations risk documents as input data for the chatbot's training
and response generation. This data contains essential information regarding the RBI's financial and
operational risk guidelines and will serve as the foundational knowledge for the chatbot.
